### Welcome

Hi,👋🏾 I'm Regis, I am a software developer with almost 4 years of professional experience(mostly Frontend development). 

Over the last three + years, I have built multiple web and mobile apps and worked with amazing teams. As I was working with different teams, I got to learn alot about DX(Developer Experience) through the use of clean code and design patterns which became something that I started to care about since then. So if you have a project where I can help hit me up.

So far I have professionally used:
- Reactjs
- React-native
- NextJS
- Typescript
- NestJs
- REST API
- GraphQL
- Hasura
- Apollo Client
- Redux
- Zustand
- Tailwindcss
- Chakra-ui
- Material-ui
- Ant Design
- styled-components
- RelayJs
- Aws CDK
- Gherkin
- Cypress

## Interest
- DX(Developer Experience) and UX(User Experience)
- Always Learning to improve my crafts
- Meeting people
- Exploring beaches 🏖
