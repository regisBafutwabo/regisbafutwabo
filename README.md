👋🏾 Hey, I'm Regis! I build cool stuff with React and Next.js.

I've shipped AI features, blockchain apps, and scalable web platforms at startups where things move fast. While I can handle both frontend and backend, my heart belongs to the frontend world.

I'm obsessed with clean, readable code that makes my teammates' lives easier. Always hunting for the latest web tech to play with and share with the team.

Let's build something awesome together!

Some of the skills I am comfortable with can be found <a href="https://regisbaf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
