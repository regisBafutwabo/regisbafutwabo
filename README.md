### Regis Bafutwabo

Hi,👋🏾 I'm Regis, I am a software developer with almost 4 years of professional experience. 

Over the last three+ years I have been learning alot on how to improve the developer experience for the teams that I work with by applying some patterns in the way we build our products so that we can create more reliable and easy to upgrade applications. 

Some of the products that I worked on includes but not limited to a blockchain explorer(React) and a blockchain wallet(React-native) for an EOS based platform, a cohort-based education platform(Next.js) and others. I have become so comfortable with GraphQL APIs that I even created an Apollo client boilerplate(ARCHIVED for now becuse I need to update it to latest version) to reduce the time people spend configuring it. I enjoy learning about new technologies that solve a specific problem. In these days, I am kinda enjoying what Nextjs has to offer since it's hitting most of my boxes😉. 

So far I have professionally used:
- Reactjs.
- React-native.
- NextJS.
- Typescript.
- NestJs.
- GraphQL
- Hasura.
- Apollo Client
- RelayJs
- Aws.
- Gherkin.
- Cypress.

## Interest

- Gaming
- Learn new things(culture, tech, languages,etc...)
