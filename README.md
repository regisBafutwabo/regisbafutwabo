### Welcome

Hi,👋🏾 I'm Regis, I am a Software Developer with a passion for tech.

Over the last three + years, I have built multiple web and mobile apps and worked with amazing people who taught me alot about DX(Developer Experience) through the use of clean code, User Experience, and design patterns which became some of the things that I started to care about since then.

Some of the skills I am comfortable with includes:
- Reactjs
- React-native
- NextJS
- Typescript
- NestJs
- REST API
- GraphQL
- Hasura
- Apollo Client
- Redux
- Zustand
- Tailwindcss
- Chakra-ui
- Material-ui
- Ant Design
- styled-components
- RelayJs
- Aws CDK
- Gherkin
- Cypress

## Interest
- DX(Developer Experience) and UX(User Experience)
- Always Learning to improve my crafts
