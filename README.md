### Regis Bafutwabo

Hi,👋🏾 I'm Regis, I am a software developer with almost 4 years of professional experience. 

Over the last three + years, I have built multiple web and mobile apps and worked with amazing teams. As I was working with different teams, I got to learn alot about DX(Developer Experience) through the use of clean code and design patterns which became something that I started to care about since then. So if you have a project where I can help hit me up.

- Reactjs
- React-native
- NextJS
- Typescript
- NestJs
- GraphQL
- Hasura
- Apollo Client
- RelayJs
- Aws
- Gherkin
- Cypress

## Interest
